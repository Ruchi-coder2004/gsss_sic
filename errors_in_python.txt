3. IndexError : List index out of range
4. ValueError : when try to cast one value to another
    ex: import sys
        number = int(sys.argv[0])

5. TypeError : if we not specify the incorrect value  in range
    ex : for i in range():
            print(i)
    ex2 : for i in range(1,2,3,4):
            print(i)

Errors are classes

all types of errors are child class of Error block

always must and should we have to place the parent except class, Otherwise it will be an SytaxError.
