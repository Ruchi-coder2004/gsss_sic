ARITHMETRIC OPERATORS:
+ - * // / % **

All oprtators are binary operators: they need 3 operands or values.

The rule/syntax says we must place operator in b/w the operands which is INFIX notation.
The I/P are numbers.
The O/P is number.
The operators + and - have the least precedence.
All the arithmetic operators except power operator has Left to Right Associtivity.

Note: The way positive integers are stored in memory, the way negative integers are stored in memory, the way floating point stored in memeory all are different.

if num = 67

for n = 067 we have to give n = 0o67

f=15, n=0Xf, n=0o87
